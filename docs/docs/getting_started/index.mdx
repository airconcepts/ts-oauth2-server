# Getting Started

## Summary

1. Implement the [entities](#) required by the Authorization Server.
1. Decide what grants you are going to Implement the [repositories](#) required by the Authorization Server.
1.

## The Authorization Server

The AuthorizationServer depends on [the repositories](#repositories). By default, no grants are enabled; each grant is opt-in and must be enabled when creating the AuthorizationServer.

You can enable any grant types you would like to support.

```typescript
const authorizationServer = new AuthorizationServer(
  clientRepository,
  accessTokenRepository,
  scopeRepository,
  "secret-key",
  {}, // optional configuration
);
authorizationServer.enableGrantType("client_credentials");
authorizationServer.enableGrantType("refresh_token");
authorizationServer.enableGrantType({
  grant: "authorization_code",
  userRepository,
  authorizationCodeRepository,
});
```

AFTER IMPLEMENTING ENTITIES THEN YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT ROUTES

See the [configuration](../configuration/index.md) documentation for a full list of config options.
